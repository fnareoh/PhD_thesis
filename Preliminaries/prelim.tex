\chapter*{Preliminaries}

This section aims at presenting the basic concepts that are needed to understand the following chapters, as well as presenting the different form of compression used in this work and how they relate to each other.

A string of length $n$ is a sequence $T[1] \dots T[n]$ of characters from a finite alphabet $\Sigma$ of size $\sigma$. The substring $T[i..j]$ is the string $T[i] \cdots T[j]$, whereas the fragment $T[i..j]$ refers to the specific occurrence of $T[i..j]$ starting at position $i$ in $T$. If $i > j$, then $T[i..j]$ is the empty string.
