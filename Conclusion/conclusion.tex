%What are my takeaways ? Future work ?
%Theoretical point of view: Elegance and power of taking a model that represents the true complexity of the input.
%Practical point of view: the need for theoretical guarantees sometimes offsetted by %the technical complexity of those results, there are important and significant work to be done on engineering to yield efficient result in practice (space seed field seems especially interesting)
