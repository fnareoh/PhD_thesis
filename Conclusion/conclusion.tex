%What are my takeaways ? Future work ?
%Theoretical point of view: Elegance and power of taking a model that represents the true complexity of the input.
%Practical point of view: the need for theoretical guarantees sometimes offsetted by %the technical complexity of those results, there are important and significant work to be done on engineering to yield efficient result in practice (space seed field seems especially interesting)

\chapter*{The Cat and the Yarn}

Inspired by the book "Le chat au pays des nombres" by Ivar Ekeland and John O'brien, which presents the Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel in a kids book format, I decided (on my own time) to sketch a comic inspired by this thesis. I dedicate it to Hana, Mira, and all the little girls that may take an interest in computer science one day.
