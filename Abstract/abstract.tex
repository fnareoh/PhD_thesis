% Overall context on strings
The simplicity of strings puts their processing at the heart of many applications, including bioinformatics, information retrieval, and cybersecurity. Exact pattern matching has been extensively studied~\cite{charras2004handbook} as the most natural problem. However, many applications also need more general queries. Additionally, in all those fields, the quantity of information to process has been increasing at a staggering rate~\cite{muir2016real}, and exact queries do not always scale.

% First part 
In the first part of this thesis, we study complex queries such as regular expressions, gapped consecutive matching, and square detection. 
% Regexp
For regular expression, we provide a space-efficient algorithm in the streaming model: characters of the text arrive one at a time, and we can only access past characters if we explicitly store them. 
% Gapped
Next, gapped consecutive matching is a simpler type of query where given two patterns $P_1$, $P_2$ and a range $[a,b]$, one must report all consecutive occurrences of $P_1$ followed by $P_2$ separated by a distance in $[a,b]$. We study this problem in various models: streaming, pattern matching on a compressed text, and compressed indexing.
% Squares
In both of those first studies, periodicity detection avoids redundant computation. This central use of periodicity makes squares interesting to study beyond their inherent meaning~\cite{Kolpakov2003}. Thus, we investigate square detection and reporting for general alphabets (the most abstract setting where squares can be defined). We provide an optimal algorithm and answer an open question asked in 1984 by Main and Lorentz~\cite{Main1984}.

% Second part
The second part of this thesis proposes to use approximate queries to speed up the computations toward scaling up to large amounts of data in bioinformatics applications.
% LCS and DTW
Motivated by the lower bounds on the computation of several similarity measures, we provide efficient parametrized algorithms for two similarity measures: the length of the Longest Common Substring with approximately k mismatches (LCS approx k) and the Dynamic Time warping distance (DTW).
% XBWT
Finally, we propose a compressed index for redundant collections of next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads, which takes advantage of alignments to an assembled genome to improve the overall compression but can incur false positive occurrences.
