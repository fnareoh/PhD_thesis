List of things to write about:

What types of problems do you tackle ?
\begin{itemize}
\item Pattern matching
\item Indexing
\item Streaming algorithm
\item Approximation 
\end{itemize}


Why is compression useful for those problems ? 
\begin{itemize}
\item practical motivation of the ever increasing data
\item theoretical motivation of the compressibility of the text allowing for faster algorithms
\end{itemize}

What type of compression is used on what problem and why ?
\begin{itemize}
\item RLE
\item Grammar
\item Lempel Ziv
\item BWT
\item Sketches
\end{itemize}


What are the links between the compressions you study ?\\
State of the art on the equivalence through string attractors\\
State of the art on practicality ?
